_into the wildlands_ is:

- a collection of recipes and tutorials
- a repository of info for my kids
- a static site generated by 11ty
- copyright &copy; 2024 by josh p. sawyer
- an experiment in stripped down websign, largely informed by:

the images on the website are mostly processed as follows:

1. take any image and reduce it's resolution to no more than 640 x 480.
2. change the aspect ratio to 16:9.
3. save the image as an 8 color, 100% dithered PNG. I'm doing this with photoshop's "save for web (legacy)" option.
