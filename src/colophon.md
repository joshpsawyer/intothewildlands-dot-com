**INTO THE WILDLANDS** is:

- a collection of recipes and tutorials
- a repository of info for my kids
- copyright &copy; 2024

the images on the website are mostly processed as follows:

1. crop the photo at a high resolution to a 4:3 aspect ratio, landscaped
2. reduce the image resolution to 256 pixels wide / 192 pixels high
3. save the image with either 16 or 32 colors and as a 100% dithered PNG. I'm doing this with photoshop's "save for web (legacy)" option.
4. the css propety `image-rendering: pixelated;` must be set or they'll be smoothed.

this site uses `Fixedsys` for headers and a stack of `Courier`, `Courier Prime`, `Courier New` or another `sans-serif` font for body text.

it should feel a bit like a clunky old late 90s / early 00s website.
