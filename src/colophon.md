_into the wildlands_ is:

- a collection of recipes and tutorials
- a repository of info for my kids
- a static site generated by 11ty
- copyright &copy; 2024 by josh p. sawyer
- an experiment in stripped down websign, largely informed by:

the images on the website are mostly processed as follows:

1. crop the photo at a high resolution to a 4:3 aspect ratio, landscaped
2. reduce the image resolution to 256 pixels wide / 192 pixels high
3. save the image with either 16 or 32 colors and as a 100% dithered PNG. I'm doing this with photoshop's "save for web (legacy)" option.
4. the css propety `image-rendering: pixelated;` must be set or they'll be smoothed.
