Cora made herself a snack and wanted me to 'put it online for everybody to read.'

## Ingredients

- Graham crackers, two 4 cracker sheets (I'd say any but - we exclusively buy
    Nabisco Honey Maid Grahams)
- Jelly, Lemon Curd, any sort of sweet spreadable filling

## Steps

1. Beak the sheets in half, so they're squares comprised of two crackers.
2. On two of the squares, spread jelly thinly.
3. Sandwich them with the other squares.
4. Wait 10-15 minutes for some of the moisture from the jelly to get into the
    cracker. You don't want the cracker to be crunchy, it should have a slight
    resistance and be more like shortbread.
