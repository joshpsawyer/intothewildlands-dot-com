At my parents bakery, they sold cinnamon rolls. We had both a commercially prepared one and we made them in house, usually
in the off-season, when we had time to experiment. These aren't those, but they are pretty good. The main recipe is derived from
a Sally's Baking Addiction recipe.[^1] The icing comes from Leif Enger's _Peace Like A River_. [^2]

1. The richer the milk, the richer cinnamon rolls. There will obviously be a difference between soy and buttermilk.
