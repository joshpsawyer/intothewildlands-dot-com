Sheila said it's insane to call a recipe Instant Pot Pot Beans. Darnold thought I
said Pop Pop Beans. Now they're Instant Pot Pop Pop Pot Beans. If you make them
with pintos, they're Insant Pot Pop Pop Pinto Pot Beans.

This is a simple recipe for soft beans that you can crush fully between your fingers and are full of flavor.
I combined two recipes[^1][^2] to arrive at this one.
