Sheila said it's insane to call a recipe Instant Pot Pot Beans. Darnold thought I
said Pop Pop Beans. Now they're Instant Pot Pop Pop Pot Beans. If you make them
with pintos, they're Instant Pot Pop Pop Pinto Pot Beans.

Combining two other recipes[^1][^2], the resulting bean is easily crushed between your fingers to a bean pulp but
retains its shape otherwise. No mealiness here, it's all bean cream, my dude.

Smash them into your tacos and they'll stay put and not mess up your beautiful shirt.
Crush 'em into a _quesadilla con huevos_ and you won't get that nasty texture mismatch.
